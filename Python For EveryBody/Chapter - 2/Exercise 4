#Exercise 4:
#Assume that we execute the flowing assignment statements:
#	width = 17
#	height = 12.0
#For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of expression)
#	1. width//2
#	2. width/2.0
#	3. height/3
#	4. 1 + 2 * 5

width = 17
height = 12.0

print (width//2)
print (width/2.0)
print (height/3)
print (1 + 2 * 5)
