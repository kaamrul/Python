# Python version 3.6.1

# Exercise 2:
# Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input. gracefully by printing a message and existing the program. The following shows two executions of the program:
#	Enter Hours : 20
#	Enter Rate : nine
# Error, please enter numeric input
#		or
#	Enter Hours : forty
# Error, please enter numeric input


hours = input("Enter Hours: ")
try:
  int(hours)
  rate = input("Enter Rate: ")
  int(rate)
  pay = int(hours)*int(rate)
  print("Pay: " + str(pay))
except:
  print("Error, Please enter numeric value")
